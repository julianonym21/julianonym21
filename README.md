### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Industrial Engineer studying at TU Berlin.
I am currently working on my master thesis. 
Whatever I'm working on at the moment, my ultimate goal in mind  is to contribute to a more sustainable mobility and traffic in this world. 
But even this requires some coding skills, that's why you can find me on GitHub.
